# DopaMath: Philosophy & Vision

**"Math is the new Scroll."**

DopaMath is a PWA designed to break the doom-scrolling loop by providing a high-dopamine, productive alternative: solving rapid-fire math problems. It engages the brain's reward system through active cognition rather than passive consumption.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **Anti-Doom Scroll**: A dedicated "Urge Killer" button for immediate intervention.
- **Prime Flow**: Sessions length based on prime number intervals (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 mins) to discourage "rounding off" time and keep the brain alert.
- **Neuro-Aesthetics**: Deep OLED blacks (Night Shift), satisfying haptics, and fluid animations to compete with the sensory appeal of social media.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
- **Progression**: Slowly increasing difficulty (Addition -> Subtraction -> Multiplication -> Division -> Mixed).
- **Life-Lines (Offline Friendly)**:
    - **50-50**: Remove 2 incorrect answers.
    - **Freeze Time**: Pause the clock for 10 seconds.
    - **Second Chance**: First wrong tap doesn't end the streak.
    - **Simplify**: Show the last digit or a rounded estimate.
    - **Skip**: Move to next problem (affects score/streak but keeps flow).
- **Controls**: 
    - Multiple choice (up to 4 options).
    - Potential "Expert Mode" with number pad input.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
- **PWA**: Fully offline capable, installable.
- **Data**: LocalStorage for stats and streaks (Zero telemetry by default).
- **Tech**: React/Preact, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion (for juice).
